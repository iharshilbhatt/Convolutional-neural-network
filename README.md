## Introduction

This project builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories, with each image being 28x28 pixels. The categories represent different types of clothing items.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- keras
- tensorflow
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib keras tensorflow scikit-learn
